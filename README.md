# Star Pattern Generator

This Python script generates a star pattern with a variable number of rows 'n'. It creates a symmetric pattern of asterisks (*) that forms a diamond shape.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

2. The script will generate a star pattern with 'n' rows, where 'n' is defined within the script.

3. The pattern is printed in the console.

## Customization

- You can customize the script by modifying the value of 'n' to change the number of rows in the star pattern.

## Example Output

For 'n' equal to 9, the script generates the following star pattern:

```
    *    
   ***   
  *****  
 ******* 
*********
 ******* 
  *****  
   ***   
    *    
```
